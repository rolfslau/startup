## AWS Notes
ssh -i [KEY PAIR DOC] ubuntu@[IP ADDRESS]
^^ command to shell into my ip address

## HTML Notes

target = "_blank" [opens links in a new tab]

## react part 2:
I need to:
[x] make the login reactive 
[x] make it store reviews put in (for all media types)
[x] have other user's "reviews" pop up


build in index.js
make an array  somewhere and save in that array

fetch requests are only frontend
edit react to ask the requests of the service

## express:
post = create something new (register)
put = update something

## db deliverable:
simon service --- authentication
middleware chunk in example code on website


to do:
[] fix authentication for login
[] make it so it actually logs you out
[] finish mongo setup
[] book reviews
[] movie reviews
[] music reviews
[] adding friends
