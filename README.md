# Mumoo Review

[My Notes](notes.md)

A site similar to Goodreads except for rating and reviewing multiple different types of media, namely: music, books, and movies. Each user will have an account and may connect with friends. They then can make reviews of different pieces of media and view their friend's reviews as well. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Do you wish that there was one place to review multiple types of media? That is what Mumoo review offers: a single app to rate media and connect with friends. Mumoo review offers reviewing for movies, music, and books. You can add your friends and see their favorite books, movies, and music as well!


### Design

Here is a quick look at what the application would roughly look like. Each user has an account, so there is a login screen. There are three different pages, one for each type of media. Users can add a new item or simply look at past reviews. They also have access to their friends, their profile, and the ability to sign out through the username button at the top right of the screen.

    User->>Server: new review
    Server -->>Friend: new review
    Server -->>User: new review
```

### Key features

- secure login over HTTPS
- Display of past reviews
- Ability to add new reviews for other pieces of media
- Ability to connect with other users and see their reviews
- Notification when friends post reviews

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Correct HTML structure for application. It will use 4 pages. One for each media type, and one for login.
- **CSS** - Application styling that fits different devices, whitespace and colors.
- **React** - When you click on each tab at the top left, it takes you to that page. When you click on the plus sign or the username, it will pop open a box with more options.
- **Service** - Using PurgoMalum to protect against inappropriate behavior from users. Interact with the database to retrieve the user's account.
- **DB/Login** - Store past reviews, and users in database. Register new users and store their accounts securely.
- **WebSocket** - Notifies other users when a new review is posted by one of their friends.
